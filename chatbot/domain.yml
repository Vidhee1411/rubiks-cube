  utter_whitecross_explanation:
    - text: "Let's talk about the white cross!\n\n First, what does the white cross even look like? On the UP face, the white cross will have the white centerpiece with the white edge pieces forming the cross. It is also important that color stickers of the white edge pieces are paired with their matching color centerpieces.\n\n We can see an example of the white cross below."
